- Deposit 1 - Land Acquisition: The contract starts with a deposit made by the "Land2023-0" role to a designated address. This deposit signifies the acquisition of a land asset related to the property development project. It involves the transfer of a token called "Land2023-1" and a constant value of 1, indicating the initial step towards property development.

- Deposit 2 - Progressing the Development: Once the first deposit is successfully completed, it triggers another deposit by the same "Land2023-0" role to the same address. This second deposit marks progress in the property development project. It involves the transfer of a different token called "Land2023-2" and a constant value of 1, signifying advancement to the next stage of development.

- Deposit 3 - Advancing Further: After the second deposit, the contract proceeds to the next stage of development. It initiates a third deposit made by the "Land2023-0" role to the same address. This deposit signifies further progress in the property development project. It involves the transfer of the "Land2023-3" token and a constant value of 1, indicating the completion of a critical milestone.

- Completion and Fund Transfer: Upon the successful completion of the third deposit, the contract reaches a specific condition. It triggers a deposit from a specified address to the "Land2023-0" role. This deposit signifies the release of funds to support the property development project.

- Contract Termination: Finally, the code concludes with a Close statement, indicating the termination of the contract execution. This signifies the completion of the defined actions and conditions within the contract.
